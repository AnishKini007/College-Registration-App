ACCTG 211 Financial and Managerial Accounting for Decision Making (4)The objective of this course is to introduce students to the discipline of accounting through an introduction to two of accounting's sub-disciplines, financial and managerial accounting. The more specific purpose is to provide students a basic understanding of the role of financial and managerial accounting information in the decisions of capital market participants external to a business enterprise (e.g., stockholders, banks, financial analysts, prospective stockholders), and in the decisions of those who manage business enterprises. Accounting information has an important role in the resource allocation process in our socio-economic system as a whole, as well as in each individual business enterprise. This course provides students an understanding of (1) the nature of the accounting function, and (2) how the information in accounting reports are used by various decision makers in their resource allocation decisions. In this course students will develop an understanding of (a) the five activity dimensions of accounting (the collection, recording, analysis, interpretation and reporting of information to decision makers for (mainly) their investment decisions), (b) the issues surrounding the five activity dimensions, (c) the environment in which accounting is practiced, and (d) what information is used in a number of specific decision situations, and how such information is used in such decision situations. The analysis, interpretation and decision-making orientation of this course includes a study of the procedural (mechanical and processing) aspects of the recording activity dimension which is an important means to the end --where the end is the analysis and interpretation of the information, and the reports produced by the recording/processing part of accounting. Through this focus on the recording activity dimension, students will obtain an understanding of (a) the nature and quality (strengths and weaknesses) of accounting information, (b) how to proceed in analyzing and interpreting accounting information, and (c) numerous other aspects of financial and managerial accounting. This course is an important background course for all business majors, as well as for numerous non-business majors.",4

AERSP 405 Experimental Methods and Projects (3) This is a senior-level elective laboratory course that builds on AERSP 305 ""Aerospace Technology Laboratory."" The first part of AERSP 405 addresses the engineering of typical data acquisition systems through a series of lectures and laboratory experiments. Data acquisition and processing are covered as they relate to a broad range of engineering experiments. Several sessions in the laboratory provide students with hands-on experience with data acquisition, followed by computer program exercises to complete the assignments. Initially the lectures are twice a week (75 minutes each). This activity comprises approximately 20 % of the total course. The major portion of the course introduces students to ""real-world"" projects in engineering and laboratory research. Students work in teams to identify, formulate, plan and solve engineering problems associated with a design or system, the completion of an experiment, or an extensive computational simulation requiring a team of students. Teams of 2 to 4 students are assigned, following student input on preferences from a list of proposed projects. Students learn, through practice, the methodology of team project engineering. The teams each develop goals for the semester's project, performed following a careful work breakdown analysis with realistic time estimations and scheduling. Many of the projects involve the design and completion of an experiment. As part of the project, students will assemble, analyze and interpret relevant data, and prepare progress and final reports (written and oral). The reports should contain graphs that go with the text to provide the necessary data interpretation. The topics in the projects have application to a variety of research programs currently underway at Penn State. At the initiation of the project activity, lectures on principles of project planning including Gantt chart preparation, work breakdown structures and critical path considerations are presented. Common best practices for the preparation of project proposals, reports, presentations and general record keeping are discussed. Overall meetings with the course instructor become bi-weekly once the projects are underway. Many of the projects also have knowledgeable graduate student or faculty consultants to assist with project planning and implementation. Project consultants conduct occasional individual review meetings with each team. Much of the project coordination work is undertaken within the regularly scheduled hours for the course. The class meetings include a combination of informal presentations by the students and, occasionally, the instructor on important technical issues. Considerable class time is spent discussing the goals and progress of individual tasks, and each student gives several brief oral presentations.",3

AERSP 440 Introduction to Software Engineering for Aerospace Engineers (3) This course is an introduction to software engineering. Software engineering includes all aspects of professional software production, and is especially important for safety-critical and mission-critical software. It includes documentation, management, processes, requirements, design models, computer programs, validation, verification, and other aspects of the development process.Aerospace systems, including aircraft, spacecraft, onboard avionics, ground-based systems, flight simulators, and air transportation systems, rely heavily on software. Software is a major cost of all aerospace systems. For example, the Boeing 777 has more than 1000 onboard processors and more than 4 million lines of software which is primarily written in Ada. The F/A-22 fighter has more than 2 million lives of software onboard, and much of this is Ada also.Aerospace systems also demand a level of reliability far beyond that of most other systems, which means the software must be designed using rigorous mission-critical and safety-critical procedures, which makes the software quite unique compared to most other software. The FAA and DOD are both involved in certifying aircraft software, for example, through the DO-178B and DOD-2168 standards.This course is required option in Aerospace Engineering (take one of AERSP 440, EE 305, or EE 210). If not taken to satisfy that requirement, it can be used as a technical elective.This course is a required option in Aerospace Engineering (take one of AERSP 440, EE 305, or EE 210).

100,Black Freedom Struggles,"This course focuses on Black freedom struggles in the United States and selected examples from other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Themes addressed may include enslaved Africans' resistance to capture and enslavement as well as post-Emancipation attempts to combat white supremacy, racial and gender inequality, labor and sexual exploitation, and political disenfranchisement. Resistance strategies include but are not limited to forging of prophetic religious tradition, marching, boycotting, forming strong families and communities, collective organizing, making art, and serving in the military in the late 19th through 21st centuries. This course will address key moments, movements, and texts in the history of Black struggles for freedom in various realms including the legal, political, religious, literary, and educational. It will also cover major (as well as lesser-known) artists, activists, writers, orators, scholars, community organizers and teachers involved in Black struggles for freedom. Students will acquire a strong basic knowledge of freedom struggles in the United State, the Caribbean, and Latin America. They will also begin to understand the relationship of black resistance to broader anti-racist, anti-colonial and anti-imperialist struggles. Assigned readings, films, and lectures will foster critical thinking, speaking, and writing skills.",3
101,African American Women,"This course offers an introduction to the sociological, historical, and political experiences of African American women, their roles and contributions to society. Through an interdisciplinary approach, we will pay particular attention to historical and contemporary responses to intersectional challenges African American women face. Drawing from the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, through the use of print and digital texts, oral histories, film, music, poetry, and local events, we will investigate various forms of social and political activism including work in labor, civil rights, black power, feminist, womanist, and other movements, the impact of popular culture on what it means to be an African American woman, as well as the implications of claiming such an identity. By focusing on key moments, institutions, and figures in history, the course demonstrates African American women's central roles in the development of American institutions as we know them today, and challenges students to engage critically with questions of race, gender, class, and sexuality, as they wrestle with theories of Black Feminist Thought and Womanism.",3
102,Women of the African Diaspora,"Women of the African Diaspora is an introduction to studying the lives of African Diaspora women and the systems of power that shape them across cultures and geographies. The course centers on the politics of race and gender, on notions of origins and belonging and the meaning of resistance as a cultural and political tool. We will engage with patriarchy as a system of power implicated in identity formation and social relations. We will pay particular attention to the ways colonial histories and racial legacies have shaped the experiences of women in Diaspora. To this end, students will explore the complex and contested ways in which multiple economic, political, and cultural institutions affect the lives of women in the diaspora and examine a variety of issues including economy and labor, mobility and Activism, creativity and literary production and spirituality and social change. Rooted in a diasporic and transnational feminist framework, the course addresses issues of power, culture, racial formation, and citizenship and explores spatiality, movement and border crossings. It follows an intersectional approach to the politics of race and gender and engages diaspora as a historical and contemporary condition that addresses the realities of women in African decent as shaped by the legacy of slavery and the contemporary racial and social pattern of globalization. Students will explore broad patterns, changes, and continuities between diasporic communities globally and the way they shaped women's experiences through an analysis of the history of colonization, slavery, independence struggles, nation-building, imperialism, neo-colonialism, revolution, violence and social movements. The course will provide and interdisciplinary perspective to develop a nuanced understanding of the histories and the lived experiences of women of African descent both globally and in the context of their local geographies. To this end, the course explores both similarities and differences of diasporic experiences. It examines the complex and contested ways in which multiple economic, political, and cultural institutions affect lives of women of African Descent both in the US and globally and by addressing the relationship between economy and labor, mobility and Activism, creativity and literary production, spirituality and social change. It challenges universal and homogenous notions of blackness and engages feminist politics of solidarity as a site of both difference and commonality. The course incorporates interdisciplinary approaches and materials such as films, music, novels, short stories to examine how racial, gender, sexual, and class identities are constructed in the context of the diaspora.",3
103,Racism and Sexism,"This survey course examines racism and sexism as cultural, political and economic processes that shape contemporary social life in the United States. It provides an historical overview of the roots of modern racism and sexism and will explore these structural inequalities continue to matter in a ""post-racial"" and ""post-feminist"" era. Students will engage a broad range of texts that discuss these forms of inequality as intersecting, mutually constituted forms of marginalization. Students will develop a deeper understanding of how race, gender, sexuality, and class conditions identity formation; racism as a structural process that shapes and limits the life chances of non-white communities; and the long tradition of resistance that women and communities of color have developed to combat these social inequalities. The course is divided into two sections. The first introduces a range of terms: race, gender, class, sexual politics, intersectionality and neoliberalism. The second half considers various case studies: mass incarceration, toxic waste, (un)natural disasters, reproductive justice, and Islamophobia in the war on terror. Students will leave with both an understanding of key theoretical terms in the study of racism and sexism and be able to apply these concepts to contemporary social issues.",3
105,Afro-Latin America: Race and Revolution,"Too often the history of race in the Americas is overly defined by concepts of racial identity and race relations in the United States. When examined quantitatively, fewer than five percent of the approximately 10 million slaves who survived the Middle Passage arrived in what we know as the United States of America. This course will examine the impact of slavery throughout the Americas, from the establishment of the plantation in Brazil through the impact of Black migration throughout the Americas today. Through lecture and discussion, we will identify patterns of racial identity and participation in the formation of the Latin American nation state that will give us a more nuanced understanding of both race and nation in the Americas. We will examine the development of the modern plantation from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century as well as the role of urban slavery in this era throughout Latin America. We will study the various paths to abolition with a particular focus on the Haitian Revolution and the common practice of military service among slave populations during the early nineteenth century struggles for Latin American independence. Additionally, we will look at the comparative abolition of slavery in the United States and Latin America, the role of slaves and free blacks in Central America, as well the role of race in the tensions between Haitians and Dominicans on the island of Hispaniola. The second half of the course will move to an examination of contemporary black politics, patterns of anti-black racism and state violence, and the emergence of new social movements for racial, gender, and economic justice in the Americas. This course meets the criteria for General Education designation in the B.A. fields of Humanities (GH), Social and Behavioral Sciences (GS), and International Cultures (IL).",3
110,Introduction to African American Studies,"This course is an introduction to African American Studies as both a political and intellectual project. We will look at the discipline's history, its most prominent thinkers and institutional locations, as well as the influence of African American Studies both inside and outside of the academy. We will consider how student protests, political and cultural movements, important thinkers, and critical debates have shaped the field and how it has changed over time in response to new political and demographic realities. Beginning with the field's origins in 1960s-era student protests, this course considers the major concepts and methodological approaches - sociological, anthropological, historical, literary - that have shaped the field since its inception in 1968. We will consider the major themes and debates that have dominated African American Studies and how they have changed over time. Focusing on critical texts including W.E.B. DuBois' The Souls of Black Folks, Angela Y. Davis' Woman, Race and Class and Michael Gomez' Reversing Sail we will follow the field's evolution from one focused on the U.S. to one that encompasses African Diasporic populations around the globe. We will assess the impact of African American Studies in colleges and universities as well as in grassroots communities. Some topics we will examine include: the difference between African American Studies as an intellectual project and African American Studies as a political project; how theories about gender inequality have shaped the field; how theories about class inequality have shaped the field; how the diasporic turn has shaped the field; what U.S. demographic trends may mean for the future of African American Studies.",3
114,"Race, Gender and Sport","In 1969, sociologist Harry Edwards declared that a surge of protest among African American athletes marked ""the newest phase of the black liberation movement in America."" Nearly five decades later, athletes such as Richard Sherman, Serena Williams, and Michael Sam proved that the relationship between race, gender, and sport remains complicated, and that athletes continue to offer meaningful contributions to a variety of struggles for liberation. This course addresses the race, gender and sport relationship from two complementary angles. First, we will examine the ways that sport gives meaning to racial and gender identity. As concepts that shift over time, race and gender derive their influence from prevailing forms of scientific reason, social attitudes, and cultural mythologies. From Jack Johnson to Serena Williams, sport has found and intervened itself in each of these contexts, particularly as society and culture produce marginal or subordinate identities. We will consider, for example, how and why sport posits the differences between men and women according to assumptions about physical strength, and how and why sport reinforces dubious assumptions regarding the physical superiority and cognitive inferiority of black athletes. Second, we will examine the ways that sport works as a setting in which political struggles around race and gender are imagined and expressed. From the 1968 stand by black track and field Olympians, to Billie Jean King's 1973 famous ""Battle of the Sexes,"" to tennis player Venus Williams' achievement of gender pay equity in 2007, to sports figures protesting on behalf of the Movement for Black Lives in 2016, athletes have long placed their social identities at the center of political speech. Finally, we will consider the historical trajectory of a narrative about the ""activist athlete,"" which once held that athletes had abdicated political obligations in pursuit of wealth, but which now seems to herald athletes' return to the nation's political scene in examples like LeBron James and Colin Kaepernick. This course will address sport's potential to rethink, resist, or challenge race and gender relations and other social hierarchies.",3
116,Muslims in America,"This course is a study of Muslims in North America, primarily the United States. It examines the multiple racial, cultural, and national groups that comprise this diverse community, starting with the historical record of the Muslims that came to the Americas as African slaves. Next, we examine African American Islam in its myriad formations. The influx of immigrants in the 1960s from the Middle East, Africa and Asia, dramatically shifted demographics in U.S. Muslim communities. Finally, we consider the post-9/11 period, which has put Islam and Muslims at the center of U.S. political and cultural discourse.",3
126,The Popular Arts in America: The History of Hip-Hop,"Hip-hop is an important and historically significant genre in popular music that initially began in the South Bronx in the early 1970s and has grown to become one of the most influential, controversial, and important genres to emerge in the last quarter of the 20th century. Beyond music, hip-hop has also been defined as a commercial enterprise, a lifestyle, and a sociocultural movement. This course explores the various meanings and manifestations of hip-hop throughout its evolution from the early 1970s to the present day. Students will examine the cultural, economic, social, and political implications of hip-hop nationally and globally. Drawing on frameworks like critical race theory and Black feminist/womanist theory, students will engage enduring debates at the heart of hip-hop-debates about art, race, class, gender, citizenship, power, and the body. Topics to be covered include: four foundational elements of hip-hop (rap, DJ arts, graffiti & visual arts, dance); the cultural, economic, political, and social conditions under which hip-hop emerged and developed; impact of hip-hop on the culture industries and the commercialization of the genre; stylistic principles that constitute the hip-hop aesthetic; racial parameters of hip-hop and notions of authenticity; gender and hip-hop's framing of black femininity and masculinity; and global circulation of hip-hop culture. Throughout the course students will explore the following questions: Under what social, political, and economic conditions did hip-hop emerge? Who were the key producers, fans, and detractors of hip-hop in its earliest years? Whose voices are privileged (and marginalized) within hip-hop studies as an academic project? How has hip-hop been framed within and/or transcended traditional notions of art and beauty? In what ways has hip-hop style been criminalized and degraded as low culture? In what ways has hip-hop style been (mis)appropriated? What is authentic hip-hop and how is it measured? To what extent do hip-hop artists pander to stereotypes? What is the relationship between hip-hop and capitalism? What are the benefits and limitations of the commercialization of hip-hop? How do fans and producers impact the genre in the contemporary digital era? What are the primary impediments to rappers who are neither black, nor male achieving the level of popularity and respect that hip-hop's biggest stars have attained? To what extent does the music industry use talent and marketability as a stand in for racial identity? How has hip-hop been taken up by marginalized groups in countries such as Brazil, Cambodia, and South Africa?",3
132,Afro-Hispanic Civilization,"A general introduction to human and cultural elements of African origin in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries of Latin America. SPAN 132 / AFR 132 / AFAM 132 Afro-Hispanic Civilization (3) (IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. The nations and peoples of Latin America have a unique, interesting historyand cultural heritage that are rooted in the traditions, beliefs, experiences,values, and struggles of Native American, European, African and otherpopulations. This course focuses on the presence and participation of Africanpeoples and their descendants in the formation and development of societies andcultures in representative areas of the Caribbean, South America, and CentralAmerica and on the evolution, diversity, and richness of the African heritagetherein. Course content includes the African background, the experience andimpact of slavery, the social, cultural, and economic heritage of slavery, therole of race in Latin America, and Afro-Hispanic intellectual, literary, andartistic developments (e.g., aspects of folklore, music).
